# sylentlyapp – Creator Revenue Co‑pilot (MVP)

This is a Streamlit-based MVP for **Sylently Partner**, focused on pricing optimization,
benchmarks, and monetization strategy for creators (with an OnlyFans-centric lookup).

It preserves and extends the functionality of the original single-file prototype:
- Public OnlyFans profile lookup via scraping (no OAuth).
- Synthetic cohort generation and percentile benchmarks.
- DM outreach suggestions.
- Whale upsell ideas.
- Pricing engine with recommended subscription & PPV ranges.
- Quick back-of-the-envelope earnings calculator.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
